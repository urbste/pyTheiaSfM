#
# Eigen SparseQR generates various compiler warnings related to unused and
# uninitialised local variables, which prevents Ceres compilation as we use
# -Werror.  To avoid having to individually suppress these warnings around
# the #include statments for Eigen headers across all GCC/Clang versions, we
# tell CMake to treat Eigen headers as system headers.  This results in all
# compiler warnings from them being suppressed.
#
# Note that this is *not* propagated to clients, ie CERES_INCLUDE_DIRS
# used by clients after find_package(Ceres) does not identify Eigen as
# as system headers.
